# SetReminderBot
A Telegram Bot that allows telegram users to set one-lined message reminders for their personal use or for group chats

Telegram bot username: @SetReminderBot

Made mainly for creating group chat reminders as most bots nowadays often require you to send parts of the details separately. This could be disruptive as the bot might take in the wrong information if another text from another group member comes in halfway through the setting process. Just simply add this bot into the group chat and type '/help' to begin and see what you can do with the bot. 

This bot can also be used for personal reminders as well, by private messaging this bot directly. 


Features:
- Set reminders
- Set repeated reminders
- View all reminders set
- Delete a reminder set
- Delete all reminders set
- Receive reminders via message from the bot in the group chat or personal chat with the bot
